        Football (soccer) is a globally popular sport where two teams of 11 players try to score by getting a spherical ball into the opposing goal, using feet, head, or torso, but not hands (except the goalkeeper). Played in two 45-minute halves, it's governed by rules (Laws of the Game) focusing on skill, tactics, and athleticism, with fouls leading to free kicks or penalties, and players receiving yellow/red cards for misconduct. Beyond soccer, "football" also refers to codes like American Football, Australian Rules, and Rugby, but association football (soccer) is the most common.
